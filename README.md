# spatial_visualisation_test
Spatial visualisation test used for Thomas International assessment.
This task is designed to see how quickly you can rotate shapes/symbols in your head. Some symbols are paired with exactly the same symbol (which has been rotated), and some are paired with a mirror image (which has been rotated).
This task requires you to identify whether the bottom symbol in the box is identical(matched) to the top symbol, or is a mirror image of the top symbol(not matched).
